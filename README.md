# 💰 Why This Tax  
> _Know where your money really goes._

**Why This Tax** is a civic-tech mobile application designed to educate India’s youth on where their taxes are spent — visualized simply and clearly.

## 🧠 What’s This Project About?

India’s taxation system can feel intimidating for students, freelancers, and first-time earners. Our app solves that by showing users:

- How their GST or income tax is distributed
- Which government sectors use their money
- What common tax myths exist (and busting them)
- A clean, mobile-first design that explains taxes with zero jargon

Built for **Gen Z**. Backed by real budget data. Inspired by open knowledge.
